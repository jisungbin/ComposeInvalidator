# Advanced usage

ComposeInvestigator has a nice set of runtime features.

### Customizing reporting formats

ComposeInvestigator has a default reporting format that you can see in
[ComposeInvestigatorConfig]. The two most important of these are stored
as variables, so they can be easily changed.

For example, you can use the [ComposableInvalidationLogger] to modify
the reporting format when a recomposition occurs, or the [stateChangedListener]
to modify the reporting format for state changes.
