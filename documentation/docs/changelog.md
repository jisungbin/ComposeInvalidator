# Change Log

ComposeInvestigator is heavily dependent on the version of [Compose Compiler](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-compiler),
so the version of ComposeInvestigator follows the format `[Compose Compiler Version - ComposeInvestigator Version]`.

In other words, you need to adjust the Compose Compiler version and Kotlin version to use ComposeInvestigator.
